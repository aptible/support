The Aptible CLI is packaged as a Ruby gem. To install it, you'll first need to make sure you have Ruby installed locally (version 1.9.2 or greater). To find out how to install Ruby on your system, refer to [the installation guide](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Next, install the gem:

    gem install aptible-cli

This will introduce a new command line application, `aptible`. To start using the tool, log in to your Aptible account with your email and password by running:

    aptible login

Then, to see what's possible with the CLI, just run:

    aptible help

If you have questions about the CLI, feel free to email us at [support@aptible.com](mailto:support@aptible.com).
