On the [Aptible Dashboard](https://dashboard.aptible.com), your apps and databases are organized by environment. This allows you to more easily group similarly-purposed apps and databases together, and also manage role-based access controls separately for each environment.


To set up additional environments beyond the default development and/or production environment provisioned for your organization, please [contact support](https://support.aptible.com/contact).
