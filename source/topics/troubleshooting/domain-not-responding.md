Each Aptible domain (VHOST) uses an [AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) to provide fault-tolerant, distributed routing for your app.

Sometimes these ELBs take several minutes to start up. If yours continues to be inaccessible, please [contact support](https://aptible.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
