subtitle: Deploy your Laravel PHP app on Aptible in about 5 minutes
---

This guide will show you how to set up a PHP app using the Laravel framework and MySQL. This guide is for Laravel 4.0 or greater.

This guide assumes you have:

- An Aptible account,
- An SSH key associated with your Aptible user account, and
- The Aptible command line tool installed

## 1. Provision Your App

Tell the Aptible API that you want to provision an application. Until you push code and trigger a build, Aptible uses this as a placeholder.

Use the `apps:create` command: `aptible apps:create $APP_HANDLE`

For example:

    aptible apps:create laravel-quickstart

## 2. Add a Dockerfile and a Procfile to Your App

Aptible uses Docker to build your app's runtime environment. A Dockerfile is a list of commands used to build that image. A Procfile is used to explicitly declare what processes Aptible should run for your app.

A few guidelines:

1. Name each file one word, capital "D"/P", no extension: "Dockerfile" and "Procfile".
2. Place both files in the root of your repository.
3. Be sure to commit both files to version control.

Here is a sample Dockerfile for a Laravel app

```dockerfile
FROM tutum/apache-php
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -yq git php5-mcrypt && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN php5enmod mcrypt

RUN rm -fr /app
ADD . /app
RUN rm /var/www/html
RUN ln -s /app/public /var/www/html

RUN composer install

EXPOSE 80
```

Here is a sample Procfile for a Laravel app:

    web: /run.sh

## 3. Provision a Database

By default, `aptible db:create $DB_HANDLE` will provision a 10GB PostgreSQL database.

In order to specify a MySQL database, use the `--type` flag:

    aptible db:create $DB_HANDLE --type mysql

`aptible db:create` will return a connection string on success. The host value is mapped to a private subnet within your stack and cannot be used to connect from the outside Internet. Your containerized app can connect, however.

Add the connection string as an environment variable to your app:

    aptible config:add DATABASE_URL=$CONNECTION_STRING --app $APP_HANDLE

## 4. Configure a Database Connection

Add the following PHP code to your `app/config/database.php` file to extract the MySQL connection info from the `DATABASE_URL` environment config you set in step 3.

```php
$url = parse_url($_ENV['DATABASE_URL']);

$host = $url["host"];
$username = $url["user"];
$password = $url["pass"];
$database = substr($url["path"], 1)
```

You can now use these variables in your MySQL config:

```php
'mysql' => array(
      'driver'    => 'mysql',
      'host'      => $host,
      'database'  => $database,
      'username'  => $username,
      'password'  => $password,
      'charset'   => 'utf8',
      'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
      'prefix'    => '',
    ),

```

## 5. Configure a Git Remote

Add a Git remote named "aptible":

    git remote add aptible git@beta.aptible.com:$APP_HANDLE.git

For example:

    git remote add aptible git@beta.aptible.com:laravel-quickstart.git

## 6. Deploy Your App

Push to the master branch of the Aptible git remote:

    git push aptible master

If your app deploys successfully, a message will appear near the end of the remote output with a default VHOST:

    VHOST laravel-quickstart.on-aptible.com provisioned.

In this example, once the ELB provisions you could visit laravel-quickstart.on-aptible.com to test out your app.
